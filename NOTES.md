# Installing Arduino IDE & Libraries

* Install the arduino IDE: `pacman -S arduino`
* Install the board-specific libraries through the IDE: Tools -> Board -> Board Manager -> Arduino/Genuino Uno
* Install the Adafruit Neopixel Library: Sketch -> Inclued Library -> Manager Libraries... -> Adafruit Neopixel
  This installs the neopixel library into `~/Arduino/libaries/` which is in scope when compiling
